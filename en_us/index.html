        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6" data-i18n="benefits_description">
            Proper use of supplements like creatine and whey protein can bring numerous benefits to your health and
            physical performance. These supplements are widely used by athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and individuals
            looking to improve body composition and optimize muscle recovery.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2" data-i18n="creatine_section">Creatine</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4" data-i18n="creatine_description">
            Creatine is one of the most studied and effective supplements for muscle mass gain and strength increase. It
            works by providing additional energy to the muscles during high-intensity exercises, allowing you to train
            harder and longer. Additionally, creatine aids in post-workout recovery by reducing muscle fatigue and
            improving performance in repetitive activities.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2" data-i18n="whey_section">Whey Protein</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4" data-i18n="whey_description">
            Whey protein is a high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids necessary for protein
            synthesis. It is ideal for post-workout consumption, helping in muscle recovery and the growth of new muscle
            tissues. Additionally, whey protein can be used as a convenient protein source for people with busy
            schedules, ensuring that daily protein needs are efficiently met.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2" data-i18n="hydration_section">Importance of Hydration</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4" data-i18n="hydration_description">
            Staying adequately hydrated is essential for the optimal functioning of the body. Water is crucial for
            temperature regulation, nutrient transport, and the removal of metabolic waste. The recommended daily water
            intake varies based on body weight and physical activity level. Dehydration can lead to a series of health
            issues, including fatigue, decreased physical and mental performance, and an increased risk of injuries.
